    # Example Windows Event Log tailer configuration
    # This configuration collects up to 10 events from the Security log
    # that were created in the last hour.
    #
    # You can copy xpaths from Windows Event Viewer:
    # 1. Open Event Viewer (eventvwr.msc)
    # 2. Navigate to the desired log (e.g., Windows Logs -> Security)
    # 3. Click "Filter Current Log..."
    # 4. Go to the XML tab and check "Edit query manually"
    # 5. Copy the XPath query and paste it below
    # 
    # Example XPath query:
    #   <Select Path="Security">*[System[TimeCreated[timediff(@SystemTime) <= 3600000]]]</Select>
    #   ==> Security: "*[System[TimeCreated[timediff(@SystemTime) <= 3600000]]]"
    - name: "Windows Security Events"
      maxEvents: 10
      xpaths:
        Security: "*[System[TimeCreated[timediff(@SystemTime) <= 3600000]]]"
